# FINAL FEND CAPSTONE TRAVEL APP
Hey there, you've managed to find my repo housing Udacity's final Travel App Project,
congratulations. Basically, this project concatenates three different API to obtain data
and display it on the webpage. 

# REMINDERS
This project runs on port: 7100 and the code in imprint.js mainly came from my Weather 
Journal Project. 

# ABOVE AND BEYOND
I decided to append an end date and display the length of the trip (which doesn't always 
work due to Weatherbit)
